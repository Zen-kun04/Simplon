# Brief 6 (Netflix like)
```
This brief is about to create a website similar to Netflix but with only basic things. No auth, no cookies, only front and JavaScript functionalities.
```

## Setup the project
---
1. > Install the project dependencies with `npm install`. The command will take all dependencies stored in package.json
2. > Build everything with `npm run build`
3. > Execute it with `npm run start`

⚠️ PLEASE READ ⚠️
- > If after runing all these commands you get an error similar to `transformer_css` or something like that, please update your NVM / Node (you can search on Google easily)
- > If you get any bug (like loading some images, scripts, or something) please delete `.cache`, `.parcel-cache` and `dist` folders
